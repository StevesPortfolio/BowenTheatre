# BOWEN THEATRE

The Bowen Theatre is a small purpose-built theatre. It has four rows and six seats in each row. They require a system to keep track of bookings. When customer books a seat they can request a specific seat using the row and seat number. Bowen Theatre Company only presents a single show or performance at a time. They do not run a show more than once, so the date and time of the show are not required when taking a booking.

This program was written as part of Certificate IV in Programming.
